# Binder + network-namespace integration debt

The binder IPC mechanism and the network-namespace redesign are written as four
forward-contract chapters:

- design [`07-9-ipc.md`](../design/07-9-ipc.md) — binder IPC, the `org.projectkennel.*`
  service registry, inter-kennel IPC, kennel spawning.
- design [`07-10-binder-netns.md`](../design/07-10-binder-netns.md) — per-kennel network
  namespace, the loopback mirror, `org.projectkennel.INet`.
- architecture [`02-7-binder.md`](02-7-binder.md) — the binder implementation contract.
- architecture [`02-8-binder-net.md`](02-8-binder-net.md) — the network-over-binder contract.
- design [`07-11-kennel-init.md`](../design/07-11-kennel-init.md) — the kennel's PID 1: the
  uid-0 construction model, privhelper-constructs-the-kennel, and the binder bus as the
  init↔kenneld lifecycle control plane.

The **rest of the corpus does not yet reflect them.** This doc is the catch-up backlog: the
owed edits to fold the four chapters into the existing design and architecture, so the corpus
is internally consistent. It is a tracking doc, not a specification — delete each entry as it
lands, and delete the doc when the list is empty. Nothing here is new design; it is the
integration of design already made.

## Settled decisions the integration must carry

So no entry re-opens a closed question:

- **Naming** is Android-convention: reserved namespace `org.projectkennel.*` (owned like
  AOSP `android.*`), services `INTERFACE/INSTANCE` (`org.projectkennel.IAfUnix/default`, …),
  node 0 is the servicemanager with `IServiceManager`-style verbs (addService / getService /
  listServices / isDeclared / getDeclaredInstances), the `isDeclared` check is the
  VINTF-declared analogue (the signed policy is the manifest). The device stays the standard
  binderfs `binder` at `/dev/binderfs/binder` with a `/dev/binder` symlink.
- **`kennel-binder`** is the unsafe ABI crate (parallel to `kennel-bpf`); binder participants
  are `kenneld` (node 0), `kennel-netshim` (consumer), **and `kennel-init`** (PID 1, the
  lifecycle consumer — added by the uid-0 inversion below). No other process links it.
- **binderfs is `FS_USERNS_MOUNT`:** the instance is mounted inside the kennel's child userns;
  no host-side mount, no binder-*specific* privhelper op; kenneld takes node 0 via
  `/proc/<pid>/root` (or `SCM_RIGHTS`). **Superseded actor/privilege (see the inversion
  section):** the mount is now done by the root-owned `kennel-init` the privhelper `execve`s,
  not the old unprivileged spawn fork, and construction *is* privileged now (the `0 0 1`
  uid map needs `CAP_SETUID`).
- **kenneld is the trust anchor and sole owner** of the reserved nodes (incl. `INet`).
  `kennel-netproxy` (CONNECT) and the host-side spawn leg (BIND mirror) are **delegates over
  a per-kennel socketpair**, not binder participants.
- **kenneld concurrency** is the non-blocking looper + bounded pending-cookie table + global
  reply-reader of [`02-7-binder.md`](02-7-binder.md) §Threading model. Blocking I/O lives in
  the delegates. A slow delegate degrades to a refusal on one instance, never a looper stall.
- **Four network modes** — `none` / `constrained` / `unconstrained` / `host` — replace the
  old `none` / `constrained` / `open`. `[net]` splits into `[net.proxy]` + `[net.bpf]`.
- **The loopback mirror:** the kennel's `/28` + `/64` exist on both sides. A workload binds
  **natively inside** the kennel net-ns (intra-kennel reach by loopback); `[[net.bpf.bind]]`
  at the cgroup `bind` hook is the allow/deny gate; every **allowed** bind is mirrored
  host-side automatically (the host-side leg binds the same `ip:port` on the host alias),
  giving host observability and (relayed through the shim) host ingress.
- **Privhelper gains two net ops** — `AddLoopbackAlias` / `RemoveLoopbackAlias` — and **no**
  binder op.

Cross-cutting open items still live in [`02-7-binder.md`](02-7-binder.md) §Open questions
(relay placement in-kenneld vs broker; af-unix shim migration; looper-pool sizing; UAPI
vendoring). They are not part of this integration; they are design still in flight.

## Owed edits — the uid-0 / `kennel-init` construction inversion (decided 2026-06-08)

A foundational change that surfaced while building binder: binderfs assigns its control and
device nodes to **uid 0 of the mounting user namespace**. The kennel's pure-identity uid map
(`{uid} {uid} 1`) provides no uid 0, so the nodes landed on the overflow uid (`nobody`, mode
`0600`) and **nothing in the kennel could open them** — proven by the full-vertical e2e
(`add_binder_device` EACCES). Beyond binder, the same gap made the view root, `/dev`, and the
RO library binds display as `nobody`/`kennel` rather than a proper root.

**Decision (see [`07-11-kennel-init.md`](../design/07-11-kennel-init.md)):** give the kennel a
real uid 0 by mapping **host root `0 0 1`** (no subuid — "there be dragons"), plus the
operator identity line. Because `0 0 1` needs `CAP_SETUID` and is a privilege-escalation
hazard if operator code can run as userns-0, the **privhelper constructs the kennel**: it
creates the userns, writes the maps, and `execve`s the **root-owned `kennel-init`** as the
trusted uid-0 **PID 1** — the only userns-0 process. `kennel-init` builds the view (system
surfaces owned by root), mounts + chowns binderfs, launches the operator-uid facades, then
forks the workload dropped to the operator and supervises it. Binder is now **integral**: the
init↔kenneld lifecycle control plane rides the binder bus (§7.11.2).

This **inverts** the prior "kenneld constructs unprivileged; the privhelper does only
add-addr / egress / gid-map" model. It supersedes that framing wherever it appears.

### Settled decisions this inversion carries

- **uid 0 = host root mapped `0 0 1`** + operator identity line; **no subuid/subgid**.
  Written by the privhelper (gains `CAP_SETUID`; already has `CAP_SETGID`). The old gid-map
  handshake (§7.2.8, deferred-gid) is subsumed: the maps are written once, fully, by the
  constructor before `kennel-init` starts.
- **The privhelper is the FACTORY** — it does *all* privileged construction in its own
  post-`clone` child, **including `pivot_root`**, before handing off. New op (e.g.
  `ConstructKennel`) over a `SOCK_SEQPACKET` socketpair: single `clone(NEWUSER|NEWNS|NEWPID|
  NEWIPC[|NEWNET])` (child C = PID 1, no double-fork); write the maps; join cgroup; bring up
  `lo`; mount the view; mount binderfs + allocate + chown the device to the operator;
  `pivot_root` + detach host root; then **`fexecve`** the trusted `kennel-init` (opened on the
  host *before* the clone — the host path is gone post-pivot; `fexecve` also keeps it out of
  the view). Returns the init/workload host pids and relays exit status. This eliminates the
  window where a uid-0 binary runs while the host fs is still visible.
- **`kennel-init` holds NO ambient host caps** — trapped post-pivot from birth; uid-0-in-userns
  gives only userns-scoped `CAP_SETUID`/`CAP_SETGID` for the drop. No `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`/
  `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. It runs no mount/netlink/device/fs-lookup/env code.
- **Pull model, zero-arg `execve`** — the privhelper execs `kennel-init` with empty argv/envp
  (no leak via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`/`environ`). `kennel-init` opens `/dev/binderfs/binder` and
  **pulls** its config: `GET_SANDBOX_PLAN` → node 0; kenneld identifies the kennel by the
  binderfs *instance* the txn arrived on (per-instance fd/looper — no token) and replies with
  the flat `kennel-spawn::wire` bytes (binder copies — no `BINDER_TYPE_PTR` → copy-isolation);
  the pty return socket rides the reply as `BINDER_TYPE_FD`. `kennel-init` retries until kenneld
  has claimed node 0.
- **The `Plan` splits THREE ways** (kenneld holds the full Plan): construction-half →
  privhelper (`ConstructKennel`, parsed host-side, no sandbox to manipulate it); supervision-half
  → `kennel-init` (the `GET_SANDBOX_PLAN` reply, parsed post-pivot/contained). Both decoders are
  bounded + fuzzed (§10.6).
- **`kennel-init` is root-owned and trusted by provenance**: its path comes from the
  deployment config (`Deployment::kennel_init()` → libexec), never the wire; the privhelper
  verifies root ownership + non-writability, opens it pre-clone, and `fexecve`s it.
- **The workload is never uid 0**: `kennel-init` forks it and drops gid → groups → uid to the
  operator (`set_gid`/`set_uid`), then `no_new_privs` + seccomp + Landlock + ulimits + pty +
  `execve` — irreversible. Facades drop the same way; **Landlock/seccomp apply to the workload
  child only** (not init/facades). Only `kennel-init` stays uid 0.
- **Lifecycle identity gate**: kenneld accepts a lifecycle verb only from
  `sender_pid == init_host_pid` (a host-side context manager sees host pids, **not** the
  kennel-internal `1`) `&& sender_euid == 0`. The init host pid is the privhelper bootstrap
  fact, not wire-supplied.
- **Exit status rides the process chain** (`kennel-init` `_exit` → privhelper → kenneld), not
  binder (which may be torn down). Binder carries in-life telemetry only.

Privilege table: privhelper gains **`CAP_SETUID`** and becomes the **constructor** (drop the "minimal add-addr/egress/gid-map only" claim). New trusted binary `kennel-init`.
