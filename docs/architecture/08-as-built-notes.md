# §8 Implementation notes: roadmap, lessons, and gotchas

The design and architecture chapters describe the system as built. This chapter
collects what does not belong in a surface description: the pieces that are
designed but not yet implemented (roadmap), the implementation lessons that
should shape the rest of the build, and the build/test gotchas that bite.

## 8.1 Roadmap — designed, not yet built

Real design intent, not dead ideas; simply not implemented yet. The chapters that
describe these read as roadmap.

- **The unified audit writer + sinks** (`02-3-audit-schema.md`): the
  journald/syslog/stdout sinks, the `[audit]` policy section / `audit.toml`, the
  per-sink timeout, and a centralised `kennel-audit` writer. Today: BPF events
  drain a lock-free ring buffer that drops on full (`kennel-bpf/src/ringbuf.rs`,
  `bpf/kennel.bpf.h`); the netproxy formats one JSONL record per request
  (`kennel-netproxy/src/audit.rs`) and owns its sink; kenneld wires a per-kennel
  file sink (`~/.local/state/kennel/<kennel>/network.jsonl`, §7.3.4). The
  journald/syslog sinks, the `[audit]` section, and a single writer are owed.
- **`kennel-checksum-verify`** (the Rust verifier of `03-crate-decomposition.md`
  / §5.5): the shell witness (`src/tools/verify-checksums.sh`, system `sha256sum`)
  is what runs today; the Rust twin lands once `sha2` is itself vendored (§5.5.1).

## 8.2 Implementation lessons (apply these to the rest)

- **The Landlock ruleset must be built *after* `pivot_root`, in the child.** A rule
  opens an `O_PATH` fd at build time and is keyed to that inode. Bind mounts preserve
  inodes (so system/home/dev rules match a parent-built ruleset), but the constructed
  `/etc` has fresh tmpfs inodes a host-opened fd would never match — libc would be
  denied `/etc`. So the seal builds the ruleset post-pivot with a *skip-missing* pass
  (a grant for a path the view doesn't contain is vacuous). See `kennel-spawn::spawn`.
- **The process is ephemeral; the work is not.** The new root is a throwaway tmpfs,
  but every *writable* bind resolves to a persistent host inode (the agent's real
  project tree), so work survives teardown. Any new writable surface must keep this
  property — never let something the workload means to keep live only on the tmpfs.
- **Fail closed, and prove it adversarially.** Every BPF decision path defaults to
  `KENNEL_DENY`; every new scope/right ships with a test that shows the *denied*
  case actually denies on the running kernel (the IPv4-mapped-IPv6 connect, the
  abstract-socket scope, the device ioctl). A test that only shows the allow path
  is half a test.
- **Landlock denial errnos differ by class.** Filesystem/network rules deny with
  `EACCES`; scoping (`SCOPE_*`) denies with `EPERM`. Accept both when asserting "the
  scope bit fired".

## 8.3 Build and test gotchas

- **Rebuild the BPF privhelper before root tests.** A workspace `cargo test` /
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` rebuilds `kennel-privhelper` with default features,
  clobbering the `--features bpf-egress` binary; the `kenneld` e2e then fails with
  `ENOSYS`. Always `cargo build -p kennel-privhelper --features bpf-egress` (and
  `kennel-netproxy`) immediately before running the gated binaries.
- **Run the gated test *binaries* directly under sudo**, not `sudo cargo` (which
  leaves root-owned files in `target/`). Compile with `--features root-tests
  --no-run`, then `sudo ./target/debug/deps/<name>-<hash>`. Use `pkill -x kenneld`,
  never `pkill -f` (which matches the harness wrapper and kills the shell).
- **Stage shim / `/etc` / new-root dirs outside `/tmp`.** The seal mounts a fresh
  tmpfs over `/tmp` before the shadow binds; a `/tmp`-staged source vanishes.
  Production stages under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; tests under `/run`.
- **Do not run `cargo fmt`.** There is no `rustfmt.toml` and the installed rustfmt
  reflows the maintainer's wider-line hand-formatting across the whole corpus. New
  code matches the surrounding style by hand.
- **A required new settled-schema field touches every fixture.** Adding a
  non-defaulted field to a policy struct forces every `FsPolicy`/`Plan` literal
  across crates into the same commit.
